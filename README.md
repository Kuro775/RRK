# RRK
Thank you for looking at my list!
The List is reside in the RRK.txt file

The list is formatted in this way: [position of White King, position of black King, position of Rook, and who turn it is]: Result

For example: [b2, d4, c3, B]: B means black draw with initial setup white king in b2, black king in d4, rook in c3 and it's black turn.
